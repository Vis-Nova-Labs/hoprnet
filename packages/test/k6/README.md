# Load Testing

This package is responsible of creating a set of load testing scenarios to be used to check performance and capacity of Hoprd network

##Â Use cases

- Generate high peaks of load to test network stability at those circumstances
- Generate high peaks of load to test hoprd node stability at those circumstances
- Generate cover traffic on nodes while there is a better cover traffic approach implemented within the hoprd node
- Generate constant traffic on nodes to test the network and their nodes against long running periods
